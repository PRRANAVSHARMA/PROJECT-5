                The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila in Hindi, is a historic fortification located in the heart of Old Delhi,
                India. Constructed by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in the mid-17th century, this UNESCO World Heritage Site served as
                the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years until the British colonization of India.

                <b>Historical Significance</b><br>
                The construction of the Red Fort began on May 12, 1639, and was completed in 1648. The fort was built to
                commemorate the Mughal victory over the last Hindu kingdom in Delhi. It was originally adorned in red and white, the
                favorite colors of Shah Jahan. The fort's design is attributed to the architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also designed
                the Taj Mahal.

                <b>Symbol of Independence</b><br>
                The Red Fort holds a special place in India's history as the site where the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal
                Nehru, hoisted the national flag on August 15, 1947, marking India's independence. Every year on Independence Day,
                the Prime Minister ceremonially raises the national flag at the main gate of the fort and delivers a nationally
                broadcast address from its ramparts.
