                    The Qutub Minar, located in the Mehrauli area of Delhi, India, is one of the most iconic landmarks in the
                    country.
                    Standing at a remarkable height of 73 meters (240 feet), it is the tallest brick minaret in the world and a
                    testament to the rich history and architectural prowess of the Mughal era.

                    Construction of the Qutub Minar began in 1199 AD under the orders of Qutb ud-Din Aibak, the founder of the Delhi
                    Sultanate. However, it was his successor, Iltutmish, who completed the project around 1220 AD. The minaret was built
                    to commemorate the victory of the Mughals over the last Hindu kingdom in Delhi.
